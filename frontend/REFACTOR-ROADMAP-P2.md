# SHADOWBID_EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md

## Current Status

The core product model has been corrected.

Old assumption:

* Auctions are text listings.
* Users create title + description + starting price.

New validated model:

* Auctions represent real assets.
* Assets are public.
* Bid amounts are private.
* Reserve prices are private.
* Winner selection is confidential until settlement.

This is now the foundation of ShadowBid.

# Current Priority

# Definition of Success

ShadowBid should communicate one idea instantly:

Public Asset.
Private Bids.

Users should understand:

* What is being auctioned.
* Why bids are hidden.
* How settlement works.

Without needing documentation.

If users need a tutorial to understand the product, the product is not finished.
