# ShadowBid Refactor Plan

## Overview

ShadowBid is a confidential sealed-bid auction platform built using Fhenix / CoFHE.

The original implementation treated auctions as text-based listings with confidential pricing.

After review, the correct product model is:

* The asset being auctioned is public.
* Bid amounts are private.
* Reserve prices are private.
* Winner determination remains confidential until settlement.

This document defines the required refactor.

# Core Product Philosophy

## Public Information

The following information should always be visible:

* Asset image
* Auction title
* Description
* Category
* Seller
* Auction duration
* Auction status
* Sealed bid count

## Confidential Information

The following information must remain encrypted:

* Reserve price
* Bid amount
* Highest bid comparison
* Winner selection before settlement

---

# Phase 1 - Data Model Refactor

## Existing Problem

Current auction model focuses on:

* Title
* Description
* Starting Price

This creates a text-based auction experience.

Users do not know what asset they are bidding on.

## New Auction Model

```ts
interface Auction {
  id: string;
  seller: string;

  title: string;
  description: string;

  category: string;

  imageURI: string;

  encryptedReservePrice: string;

  duration: number;

  revealWindow: number;

  status:
    | "ACTIVE"
    | "SETTLEMENT"
    | "FINALIZED";

  sealedBidCount: number;

  createdAt: number;
}
```

## Bid Model

```ts
interface Bid {
  auctionId: string;

  bidder: string;

  encryptedBidAmount: string;

  submittedAt: number;
}
```

# Phase 9 - Asset Storage Strategy

## MVP

Only bids require privacy.

Reserve Price

## Preferred Terms

# Definition of Success

A user can:

1. Create an auction for a visible asset.
2. Set an encrypted reserve price.
3. Receive encrypted bids.
4. Finalize settlement.
5. Reveal winner without exposing bid amounts during the auction.

The platform should feel like a professional confidential auction system rather than a text-based listing application.
