    title: 'How ShadowBid Works',
    content: `ShadowBid is a sealed-bid auction protocol built on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
    Unlike traditional auctions where bids are visible to everyone, ShadowBid keeps all bid amounts
    encrypted on-chain — even the smart contract itself cannot read them. Only the final winner is
    revealed after settlement.`,
  },
  {
    icon: Lock,
    title: 'Encrypted Bids',
    content: `When you place a bid, your bid amount is encrypted in your browser using Fhenix CoFHE
    before being submitted to the blockchain. The contract uses FHE operations (CMUX) to compare
    encrypted bids without ever decrypting them. This means no one — not the seller, not other
    bidders, not even the contract — can see your bid amount during the auction.`,
  },
  {
    icon: Eye,
    title: 'Settlement & Reveal',
    content: `After the bidding period ends, the seller finalizes the auction. This makes the winner's
    identity and bid amount publicly decryptable via the Threshold Network. Anyone can then call
    revealWinner() to publish the decrypted results on-chain. Losing bids are never revealed.`,
  },
  {
    icon: Wallet,
    title: 'ETH Deposits & Refunds',
    content: `To place a bid, you must deposit ETH equal to or greater than your bid amount. This ETH
    is held in escrow during the auction. If you win, the seller receives your deposit. If you lose,
    you can claim a full refund after the auction is settled.`,
  },
  {
    icon: Code,
    title: 'Smart Contract',
    content: `ShadowBid is deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia testnet. The contract uses the @fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts
    library for FHE operations. All encrypted state is managed through euint64 (encrypted uint64) and
    eaddress (encrypted address) types.`,
  },
  {
    icon: FileText,
    title: 'For Developers',
    content: `The codebase is open source. The contract is written in Solidity with Hardhat. The frontend
    uses React, Vite, TypeScript, wagmi, and RainbowKit. FHE operations are handled by the CoFHE SDK.
    Contributions are welcome.`,
